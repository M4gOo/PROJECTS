Kubernetes focuses on the application workloads, not the underlying infrastructure components. 
Kubernetes provides a declarative approach to deployments, backed by a robust set of APIs for management operations.
Kubernetes supports both stateless and stateful applications as teams progress through the adoption of microservices-based applications.
AKS provides a managed Kubernetes service that reduces the complexity of deployment and core management tasks, like upgrade coordination. 
The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.
