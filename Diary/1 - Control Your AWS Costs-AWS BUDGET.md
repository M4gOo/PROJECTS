#  AWS BUDGET

To make sure you don't exceed the Free Tier usage thresholds and your overall budget, we recommend using AWS Budgets
It is a best practice to create a total monthly cost budget for each AWS account you use. 

AWS Budgets has a Free Tier limit of 62 budget days per month, so creating a single budget falls within the AWS Free Tier limit.

2 - AWS Free Tier Usage Limit email alerts

By default, most accounts are automatically opted in to receive AWS Free Tier Usage Limit email alerts when their service usage exceeds 85% of a given Free Tier usage limit.
 
choose Billing Preferences from the left navigation bar and thick the box for Free Tier Usage Alerts
