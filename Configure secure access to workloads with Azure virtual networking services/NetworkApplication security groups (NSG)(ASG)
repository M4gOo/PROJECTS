=========  NSG   x    FIREWALL  =====================

NSG works like a firewall. 
Azure Firewall monitors traffic at more of a global level
NSG is more defined and is applied to specific subnets and/or network interfaces. 
Both firewall and NSG allow you to apply rules based on IP addresses, port numbers, networks, and subnets.


---- Outbound
traffic allowed to leave your network through secured ports to reach legitimate destinations. They stop requests sent to malicious websites and untrusted domains.
