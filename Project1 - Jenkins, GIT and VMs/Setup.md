### GITHUB
In the github I used the repo https://github.com/M4gOo/hello-world-MAVEN-Project1
I had to create a token, then jenkins can have access (usually when it is private repo). In my case, I did just to practice.

### VMs
I installed java, maven and git packages controller and slave(webserver)
