Configuring and integrate a Log Analytics agent with a workspace in Defender for Cloud via the Azure portal gives:
A boost in security analysis
Enabling organizations to centralize and leverage security logs for proactive security monitoring

Defender for Cloud collects data from your Azure virtual machines (VMs), Virtual Machine Scale Sets, IaaS containers, and non-Azure (including on-premises) machines to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats.
Some Defender plans require monitoring components to collect data from your workloads.
When the Log Analytics agent is on, Defender for Cloud deploys the agent on all supported Azure VMs and any new ones created.

Azure Log Analytics provides the tools and capabilities to configure and manage the Log Analytics agent in Defender for Cloud. It allows organizations to set up and manage data collection, query logs, and configure alerts and notifications

Data collection is required to provide visibility into missing updates, misconfigured OS security settings, endpoint protection status, and health and threat protection. 
Data collection is only needed for compute resources such as VMs, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, IaaS containers, and non-Azure computers.

You can benefit from Microsoft Defender for Cloud even if you donâ€™t provision agents. However, you'll have limited security and the capabilities

### Data is collected using:
- Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- Log Analytics agent
- Azure Policy Add-on for Kubernetes


### Use the Log Analytics agent if you need to:
- Collect logs and performance data from Azure virtual machines or hybrid machines hosted outside of Azure.
- Send data to a Log Analytics workspace to take advantage of features supported by Azure Monitor Logs, such as log queries.
- Use VM insights, which allow you to monitor your machines at scale and monitor their processes and dependencies on other resources and external processes.
- Manage the security of your machines by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud or Microsoft Sentinel.
- Use Azure Automation Update Management, Azure Automation State Configuration, or Azure Automation Change Tracking and Inventory to deliver comprehensive management of your Azure and non-Azure machines.
- Use different solutions to monitor a particular service or application.

### What event types are stored for "Common" and "Minimal"?
The Common and Minimal event sets were designed to address typical scenarios based on customer and industry standards for the unfiltered frequency of each event and their usage.

- Minimal - This set is intended to cover only events that might indicate a successful breach and important events with low volume. Most of the data volume of this set is successful user logon (event ID 4624), failed user logon events (event ID 4625), and process creation events (event ID 4688). Sign out events are important for auditing only and have relatively high volume, so they aren't included in this event set.
- Common - This set is intended to provide a full user audit trail, including events with low volume. For example, this set contains both user logon events (event ID 4624) and user log off events (event ID 4634). We include auditing actions like security group changes, key domain controller Kerberos operations, and other events that are recommended by industry organizations.
