Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a solution that finds weak spots across your cloud configuration, helps strengthen the overall security posture of your environment, and can protect workloads across multicloud and hybrid environments from evolving threats.


Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs as you manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises:

- Defender for Cloud secure score continually assesses your security posture so you can track new security opportunities and precisely report on the progress of your security efforts.
- Defender for Cloud recommendations secures your workloads with step-by-step actions that protect your workloads from known security risks.
- Defender for Cloud alerts defends your workloads in real-time so you can react immediately and prevent security events from developing.


Microsoft Defender for Cloud's features covers the two broad pillars of cloud security:

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) - Remediate security issues and watch your security posture improve
Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) - Identify unique workload security requirements

Because Defender for Cloud is an Azure-native service, many Azure services are monitored and protected without needing any deployment, but you can also add resources that are on-premises or in other public clouds.

When necessary, Defender for Cloud can automatically deploy a Log Analytics agent to gather security-related data. For Azure machines, deployment is handled directly. For hybrid and multicloud environments, 
Microsoft Defender plans are extended to non-Azure machines with the help of Azure Arc. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) features are extended to multicloud machines without the need for any agents.
